# Uber and Lyft Price Prediction and EDA

## Introduction :

1. **Context**:
In today's fast-paced urban environments, ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft have become integral to daily commuting. However, the dynamic pricing models employed by these services often leave users uncertain about the cost of their rides. This project seeks to address this issue by applying data-driven EDA techniques and predictive modeling to enhance users' understanding of price fluctuations and enable them to plan their journeys more effectively. Such insights have the potential to revolutionize the ride-sharing industry and benefit both customers and service providers.

2. **Motivation**:
In an era where urban mobility plays a pivotal role in people's daily lives, understanding and predicting ride-sharing prices for services like Uber and Lyft is of paramount importance. This project aims to harness the power of data analysis and predictive modeling to provide users with valuable insights and enable them to make informed choices, ultimately enhancing their transportation experience and optimizing cost-efficiency.

3. **Objective**:
The primary objective of this project is to conduct comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on ride-sharing data from Uber and Lyft, followed by the development and evaluation of predictive models. By achieving this, we aim to empower both riders and service providers with accurate price forecasts, contributing to improved affordability, convenience, and transparency in the urban transportation landscape..
   
## Methodology :

We will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, beginning with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a holistic understanding. Subsequently, we will engage in data cleaning, identifying missing values, numerical variable distributions, and leveraging the Seaborn library for visualizations to detect outliers and categorical variables. A pair plot will be generated to visualize 2D relationships between features, aiding in the selection of the most suitable machine learning model. The potential algorithms to be considered include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
